A company needs a program that reads an employee’s name, hours worked and rate per hour.
The program should calculate the basic pay (hours worked × rate per hour).

Tax is based on basic pay as follows:

Basic Pay	Tax Rate

Over 50000	20% of basic pay
20000 – 50000	10% of basic pay
Below 20000	Zero tax


Write a Python program that:

1. Asks the user to enter employee name, hours worked and rate per hour


2. Calculates the basic pay


3. Uses an if…else statement to determine tax


4. Calculates net pay (net pay = basic pay − tax)


name = input("Enter employee name: ")
hours = float(input("Enter hours worked: "))
rate = float(input("Enter rate per hour: "))

basic = hours * rate

if basic > 50000:
    tax = basic * 0.20
elif basic >= 20000:
    tax = basic * 0.10
else:
    tax = 0

net = basic - tax

print("Name:", name)
print("Basic Pay:", basic)
print("Tax:", tax)
print("Net Pay:", net)
