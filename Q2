Question: Creating a Simple Payroll System

The HR system needs to process payroll for the company’s employees, but there are different types of employees depending on how their payroll is calculated.

(i)Implement a base class called Employee that handles the common interface for every employee type.
The Employee class is initialized with an emp_id and a name.
Every employee must have both an ID and a name.

The HR system requires that every employee processed must have a method called calculate_payroll(), which returns the weekly salary for that employee.
The implementation of this method differs depending on the type of employee.

(ii)Create a derived class called SalaryEmployee that inherits from Employee.
The class is initialized with emp_id, name, and a new parameter weekly_salary, which represents the amount the employee makes per week.

Use super() to inherit from the base class.
Implement the calculate_payroll() method to return the value of weekly_salary.


(iii)The company also has hourly workers who are paid based on the number of hours they work.
Create a class HourlyEmployee that inherits from Employee.
The class should be initialized with emp_id, name, hours_worked, and hourly_rate.

Implement the calculate_payroll() method to return hours_worked * hourly_rate.

(iv)The company also employs sales associates who are paid through a fixed salary plus a commission based on their sales.

Create a class CommissionEmployee that inherits from SalaryEmployee.
This class should be initialized with emp_id, name, weekly_salary, and an additional commission value.

The calculate_payroll() method should return the sum of the weekly salary and the commission (weekly_salary + commission).


class Employee:
    def __init__(self, emp_id, name):
        self.emp_id = emp_id
        self.name = name

    def calculate_payroll(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclass must implement this method")


class SalaryEmployee(Employee):
    def __init__(self, emp_id, name, weekly_salary):
        super().__init__(emp_id, name)
        self.weekly_salary = weekly_salary

    def calculate_payroll(self):
        return self.weekly_salary


class HourlyEmployee(Employee):
    def __init__(self, emp_id, name, hours_worked, hourly_rate):
        super().__init__(emp_id, name)
        self.hours_worked = hours_worked
        self.hourly_rate = hourly_rate

    def calculate_payroll(self):
        return self.hours_worked * self.hourly_rate


class CommissionEmployee(SalaryEmployee):
    def __init__(self, emp_id, name, weekly_salary, commission):
        super().__init__(emp_id, name, weekly_salary)
        self.commission = commission

    def calculate_payroll(self):
        return self.weekly_salary + self.commission


emp1 = SalaryEmployee(101, "Alice", 1200)
emp2 = HourlyEmployee(102, "Bob", 40, 25)
emp3 = CommissionEmployee(103, "Charlie", 1000, 300)

print(f"{emp1.name} - Weekly Pay: ${emp1.calculate_payroll()}")
print(f"{emp2.name} - Weekly Pay: ${emp2.calculate_payroll()}")
print(f"{emp3.name} - Weekly Pay: ${emp3.calculate_payroll()}")
