A company awards bonuses to employees depending on their years of service as follows:

Years of Service	Bonus Rate

More than 10 years	12%
Between 6 and 10 years	10%
Less than 6 years	8%


Write a Python program that:

1. asks the user to input their salary and number of years worked


2. calculates and prints the bonus amount




salary = float(input("Enter salary: "))
years = float(input("Enter years of service: "))

if years > 10:
    rate = 0.12
elif years >= 6:
    rate = 0.10
else:
    rate = 0.08

bonus = salary * rate
print("Bonus Amount:", bonus)
