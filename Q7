Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a list of names.
The program should then sort the names alphabetically, remove any duplicates, and display the final sorted list.
Finally, display the total number of names entered by the user.


names = input("Enter names separated by spaces: ").split()
names = list(set(names))
names.sort()
print("Sorted names:", names)
print("Total number of names:", len(names))
