Library Fine Calculation

You are required to write a Python program that calculates the fine charged for overdue books in a library.

The library charges fines according to how many days late the book is returned, as shown below:

Days Overdue	Charge per day

Up to 7 days	Ksh. 20
8 – 14 days	Ksh. 50
15 or more	Ksh. 100


TASKS

i) Write a Python program that will accept the following details from the user:

bookID

dueDate

returnDate
(3 marks)


ii) Calculate the number of days the book is overdue.
Hint: daysOverdue = returnDate – dueDate
(2 marks)

iii) Use an if…else decision structure to select the correct fine rate from the table above, then calculate the total fine.
(6 marks)

iv) The program should then display the following output:

bookID

dueDate

returnDate

daysOverdue

fineRate

fineAmount
(4 marks)




bookID = input("Enter Book ID: ")
dueDate = int(input("Enter Due Date (day number): "))
returnDate = int(input("Enter Return Date (day number): "))

daysOverdue = returnDate - dueDate

if daysOverdue <= 0:
    fineRate = 0
elif daysOverdue <= 7:
    fineRate = 20
elif daysOverdue <= 14:
    fineRate = 50
else:
    fineRate = 100

fineAmount = daysOverdue * fineRate

print("Book ID:", bookID)
print("Due Date:", dueDate)
print("Return Date:", returnDate)
print("Days Overdue:", daysOverdue)
print("Fine Rate: Ksh.", fineRate)
print("Fine Amount: Ksh.", fineAmount)
