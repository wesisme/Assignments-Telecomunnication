Write a Python program that asks the user for an employee's name, hours worked, and hourly rate; calculates the basic pay (hours × rate); applies tax to the basic pay using the table below; and calculates the net pay (basic pay − tax).

Basic pay	Tax

Over 50000	20% of basic pay
Between 20000 and 50000 (inclusive of 20000, up to 50000)	10% of basic pay
Below 20000	Zero tax


Your program should prompt for input, compute basic pay, compute tax according to the table, and print the basic pay, tax, and net pay.


name = input("Employee name: ")
hours = float(input("Hours worked: "))
rate = float(input("Rate per hour: "))
basic_pay = hours * rate
if basic_pay > 50000:
    tax = basic_pay * 0.20
elif basic_pay >= 20000:
    tax = basic_pay * 0.10
else:
    tax = 0.0
net_pay = basic_pay - tax
print(f"Name: {name}")
print(f"Basic pay: KSh {basic_pay:.2f}")
print(f"Tax: KSh {tax:.2f}")
print(f"Net pay: KSh {net_pay:.2f}")
